 I want you to explain code files line by line in a detailed, educational way. 

For each file:
1. Start with the header file (.h) first, then the implementation file (.cpp)
2. Break down the code into logical sections
3. Explain each line or small group of related lines
4. Use clear headings with line numbers (e.g., "Lines 10-15: Function name")
5. Include the actual code snippets being explained
6. Provide concrete examples with sample data showing how the code works
7. Use simple language suitable for beginners
8. Highlight important concepts like why certain patterns are used
9. Show complete walkthroughs with real data when explaining algorithms
10. Wait for me to say "yes" or "next" before moving to the next file

Format:
- Use markdown formatting
- Use code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Bold important terms
- Include visual examples and walkthroughs
- Add "Say 'yes' for the next file!" at the end

Style:
- Educational and thorough
- Break down complex concepts into simple steps
- Assume I'm learning C++ and programming concepts
- Explain "why" not just "what"
